# Purple-Martin-Migration-Analysis

This project tracks Purple Martins' migration between North and South America, focusing on the overlap between their routes and protected areas. By leveraging geographic data, we aim to assess conservation efforts and ensure these vulnerable birds reach safe habitats. The analysis uses pandas, geopandas, folium and matplotlib for spatial visualization.
